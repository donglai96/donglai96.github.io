I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [experimental space physics group](https://www.space.ucla.edu) at UCLA. My research focus is plasma physics processes and global modeling in the near-Earth space environment. I am interested in applying advanced machine learning techniques and high-performance computing method to modeling and understanding the space environment. I am also currently working on the space plasma experiments in the [Large Plasma Device](https://plasma.physics.ucla.edu/) (LAPD).

I received my Ph.D. in space physics from UCLA in 2024 supervised by [Prof. Jacob Bortnik](https://atmos.ucla.edu/space/personnel/), as well as my Bachelor degrees in space physics and computer science from University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in 2019.
